The purpose of this Java Program is to allow users to login using their username and password, which will take them to a homepage where they only logout (I am still working on the homepage and it's function).
For the new users, the program allows for them to register, after registering they have to login then they will be taken to the homepage.

I made use of HTML 5 but in JSP pages, CSS, Java pages for my servlets.
System.out.println("Thanks for having a look at my cool code");
